When using 'git grep -i <sometext>' I find that it can often be useful to print line numbers
using the flag '-n' i.e. 'git grep -in <sometext>'.

Sometimes it can also be useful to print the 'x' following lines, not containing <sometext> 
in order to gain an overview of some specific part of a large code i.e.: 'git grep -inA x <sometext>'
